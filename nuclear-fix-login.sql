-- üö® NUCLEAR OPTION: Disable Email Confirmation Completely
-- Copy paste dan RUN di Supabase SQL Editor untuk FIX FINAL

-- STEP 1: Confirm ALL existing users instantly
UPDATE auth.users 
SET 
    email_confirmed_at = COALESCE(email_confirmed_at, NOW()),
    email_confirm_status = 1,
    confirmed_at = COALESCE(confirmed_at, NOW())
WHERE email_confirmed_at IS NULL OR confirmed_at IS NULL;

-- STEP 2: Specifically fix the problematic user
UPDATE auth.users 
SET 
    email_confirmed_at = NOW(),
    email_confirm_status = 1,
    confirmed_at = NOW(),
    last_sign_in_at = NULL  -- Reset login attempts
WHERE email = 'selginovsakti@gmail.com';

-- STEP 3: Check if Supabase has email confirmation settings
-- This will show current auth settings
SELECT 
    'Current user status:' as info,
    COUNT(*) as total_users,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as confirmed_users,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN email_confirmed_at IS NULL THEN 1 END) as unconfirmed_users

-- STEP 4: Show specific user status
SELECT

    confirmed_at,
    email_confirm_status,
    created_at,
    CASE

        ELSE '‚ùå STILL BLOCKED'
    END as login_status
FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'selginovsakti@gmail.com';

-- STEP 5: Create a test user with instant confirmation
INSERT INTO auth.users (

    id,

    role,
    email,
    encrypted_password,

-- STEP 6: Final verification
