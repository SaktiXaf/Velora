# Authentication Status: Not Logged In

## Current Issue
The logs show that you are not currently logged in to the app:
```
isAuthenticated: false
user: null
```

This is why:
- Profile editing fails with authentication errors
- Home screen shows welcome screen instead of activities
- App features are limited to unauthenticated users

## Solution: Log In to Your Account

### Step 1: Go to Profile Tab
The profile screen should show a login interface with:
- **Login** button 
- **Register** button
- Welcome message

### Step 2: Choose Login or Register

#### **If You Have an Account:**
1. Click **"Login"** button
2. Enter your email/username and password
3. Click submit

#### **If You Don't Have an Account:**
1. Click **"Register"** button  
2. Fill out the registration form
3. Create your account

### Step 3: Verify Login Success
After successful login, you should see:
```
✅ Auth: Setting user: [your-email]
✅ Auth initialization complete
isAuthenticated: true
```

## What to Expect After Login

### ✅ **Profile Tab:**
- Your profile information loads
- Profile editing works normally
- Data syncs across devices

### ✅ **Home Tab:**  
- Shows your activities
